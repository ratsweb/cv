          Hi, it's Yoon here. I'm almost 15 years old, and I just graduated middle school. After summer break, I'll be going off to high school. During my free time, I particularly enjoy either reading romance novels or watching
          Korean dramas. I usually like contemporary and historical romances, and I can only watch rom-com kdramas. So, I made this website to display my hobbies.
