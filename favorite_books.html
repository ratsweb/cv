          <em>Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most.</em>
          Lily hasn‚Äôt always had it easy, but that‚Äôs never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She‚Äôs come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up‚Äî she
          graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily‚Äôs life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.
          Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He‚Äôs also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn‚Äôt hurt. Lily can‚Äôt get him out of her head. But Ryle‚Äôs complete
          aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his ‚Äúno dating‚Äù rule, she can‚Äôt help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.
          As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan ‚Äî her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has
          built with Ryle is threatened.

          Easily the shyest Wallflower, Evangeline Jenner stands to become the wealthiest, once her inheritance comes due. Because she must first escape the clutches of her unscrupulous relatives, Evie has approached the rake Viscount St. Vincent
          with a most outrageous proposition: marriage!
          Sebastian's reputation is so dangerous that thirty seconds alone with him will ruin any maiden's good name. Still, this bewitching chit appeared, unchaperoned, on his doorstep to offer her hand. Certainly an aristocrat with a fine eye for
          beauty could do far worse.
          But Evie's proposal comes with a condition: no lovemaking after their wedding night. She will never become just another of the dashing libertine's callously discarded broken hearts‚Äîwhich means Sebastian will simply have to work harder at
          his seductions... or perhaps surrender his own heart for the very first time in the name of true love.

          Cassandra DeWitt has seen her husband only once--on their wedding day two years earlier--and this arrangement suits her perfectly. She has no interest in the rude, badly behaved man she married only to secure her inheritance. She certainly
          has no interest in his ban on her going to London. Why, he'll never even know she is there.
          Until he shows up in London too, and Cassandra finds herself sharing a house with the most infuriating man in England.
          Joshua DeWitt has his life exactly how he wants it. He has no need of a wife disrupting everything, especially a wife intent on reforming his behavior. He certainly has no need of a wife who is intolerably amiable, insufferably reasonable
          ... and irresistibly kissable.
          As the unlikely couple team up to battle a malicious lawsuit and launch Cassandra's wayward sister, passion flares between them. Soon the day must come for them to part.

        <p>
          The year is 1881. Meet the Mackenzie family‚Äîrich, powerful, dangerous, eccentric. A lady couldn't be seen with them without ruin. Rumors surround them‚Äîof tragic violence, of their mistresses, of their dark appetites, of scandals that set
          England and Scotland abuzz.
          The youngest brother, Ian, known as the Mad Mackenzie, spent most of his young life in an asylum, and everyone agrees he is decidedly odd. He's also hard and handsome and has a penchant for Ming pottery and beautiful women.
          Beth Ackerley, widow, has recently come into a fortune. She has decided that she wants no more drama in her life. She was raised in drama‚Äîan alcoholic father who drove them into the workhouse, a frail mother she had to nurse until her
          death, a fussy old lady she became constant companion to. No, she wants to take her money and find peace, to travel, to learn art, to sit back and fondly remember her brief but happy marriage to her late husband.
          And then Ian Mackenzie decides he wants her.
